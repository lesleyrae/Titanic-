# Titanic
# This project used machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Used GridSearchCV to search best parameters for different models and used the stacked model to combine all models with good performances.

# This data&background comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

# train.csv --- The dataset to train the model
# test.csv ---- The dataset to test the model
# Titanic_Project.ipynb --- The walk-through scripts of the project in the format of ipynb.
# TitanicProjectedition.pdf --- A PDF version of the walk-through script.
